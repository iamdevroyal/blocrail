I will completely rebuild the landing page to align with the new strategic positioning: **"The Operating System for AI-Powered Live Commerce"**. This involves a major structural overhaul, replacing generic marketing sections with infrastructure-grade, investor-ready narratives.

### **Plan of Action**

1.  **Create New Section Components**
    I will create dedicated components for each strategic section to ensure modularity and precise content control:
    *   `GlobalThesisSection.vue`: "Live Commerce Is Growing. Infrastructure Is Lagging." (Replaces Problem)
    *   `PhaseOneSection.vue`: "Production-Ready Payment Rails" (The "Now" state)
    *   `PhilosophySection.vue`: "Infrastructure First" (Strategic justification)
    *   `EcosystemRoadmapSection.vue`: "Where Blocrail Is Headed" (The "Future" state)
    *   `AILayerSection.vue`: "Intelligence Built Into Commerce" (The AI Vision)
    *   `ScaleSection.vue`: "Designed for Platform-Scale Growth" (Technical depth)
    *   `ProductionSection.vue`: "Production-Grade by Design" (Security & Reliability)
    *   `ClosingSection.vue`: Final Vision & Call to Action.

2.  **Refactor Existing Components**
    *   `HeroSection.vue`: Rewrite to feature the "Operating System" headline, phased rollout badges, and dual CTAs. Remove "social commerce" references.
    *   `PricingSection.vue`: Update to "Clear Infrastructure Pricing" (3-6% volume-tiered), removing "start for free" marketing language in favor of "pay when transactions happen".
    *   `FooterSection.vue`: Add the investor signal: "Blocrail is currently in phased rollout."

3.  **Update Landing Page Layout (`LandingPage.vue`)**
    *   Replace the current component stack with the new sequence:
        1.  `HeroSection`
        2.  `GlobalThesisSection`
        3.  `PhaseOneSection`
        4.  `PhilosophySection`
        5.  `EcosystemRoadmapSection`
        6.  `AILayerSection`
        7.  `ScaleSection`
        8.  `ProductionSection`
        9.  `PricingSection`
        10. `ClosingSection`
    *   Apply global visual updates: sharper typography, reduced border-radius (for a technical feel), and abstract/grid backgrounds.

4.  **Visual & Tone Enforcement**
    *   **Typography**: Ensure crisp headers and legible body text.
    *   **Imagery**: Use code-like or abstract grid visuals instead of generic illustrations.
    *   **Language**: Strictly follow the provided copy in `refinement.md`, avoiding buzzwords and regional references.
